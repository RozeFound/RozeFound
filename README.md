Hi, I'm D.D. aka RozeFound aka Blind Bandit, but you can call me Rozy. 

For now I'm an active EndeavourOS user, with Gnome in one hand and too-many-(really handy)-cli-tools in the other. I speak Russian and English (not quite good, because you probably already noticed a lot of grammar mistakes which I didn't), and love to translate things to my native language.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on Discord at `розт#0639`, or on [Fabulously Optimized Discord server](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) since I spend a lot of time with these folks.
