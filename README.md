Hi, I'm D.D. aka RozeFound aka Blind Bandit, but you can call me Rozy. We are friends now, right? So let's watch some anime ðŸ˜œ

Just a usual C++/Python programmer nothing special (Yes, I know that these languages do not look particularly compatible)
I prefer C++ but currently I don't write C++ because there are no suitable projects :c

For now I'm an active Archáµ‡áµ—Ê· linux user, with KDE Plasma in one hand and too-many-cli-tools in the other. I speak Russian and English (not quite good, because you probably already noticed a lot of grammar mistakes which I didn't), and love to translate things to my native language.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on Discord at `Ñ€Ð¾Ð·Ñ‚#0639`, or on [Fabulously Optimized Discord server](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) since I spend a lot of time with these folks.
