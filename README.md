Hi, I'm D.D. aka RozeFound aka Blind Bandit, but you can call me Rozy. We are friends now, right? So let's watch some anime and play video games 😜

Just a casual C++/Python programmer, nothing special (Yes, I know that these languages do not look particularly compatible) \
I personally prefer C++ but there are currently no suitable projects :c ... Feel free to suggest me a project where my contributions would be welcome! 

For now I'm an active Fedora linux user, with Gnome in one hand and too-many-(really handy)-cli-tools in the other. I speak Russian and English (not quite good, because you probably already noticed a lot of grammar mistakes which I didn't), and love to translate things to my native language.

If you want to contact me, you can find me on Discord at `розт#0639`, or on [Fabulously Optimized Discord server](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) since I spend a lot of time with these folks.
